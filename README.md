Finding changes of interest in chest X-rays in ICU
In the ICU, doctors compare chest X-rays taken at different time points to monitor a patient’s condition.
However, this task is challenging due to the complex nature of X-ray images.
Since X-rays are 2D images of three-dimensional anatomical structures, overlapping structures may obscure clinically significant details.
Image quality is often poor, particularly when patients cannot be properly positioned.
Differences in angle, lighting, and exposure pose additional challenges for comparison.
The presence of multiple health conditions introduces additional complexity.
