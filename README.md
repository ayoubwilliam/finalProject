Finding changes of interest in chest X-rays in ICU
In the ICU, doctors compare chest X-rays from different times to track a patient’s condition. This is difficult because X-rays are 2D projections of complex 3D anatomy, so overlapping structures can hide important findings. Image quality is often low when patients cannot be positioned well. Variations in angle, lighting, and exposure make comparisons harder, and multiple health issues add further complexity.



Our goal is to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained using synthetic data, capable of detecting and localizing differences between two consecutive X-ray images.
