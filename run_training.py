"""
End-to-end pipeline runner.
Executes all 4 stages in sequence: Segmentation → Data Generation → Training → Evaluation.
Supports a --data-fraction flag to use a percentage of available CT scans for faster runs.

Usage:
    python run_all.py /path/to/ct/scans            # run full pipeline with all data
    python run_all.py /path/to/ct/scans --data-fraction 0.5 # use 50% of CT scans
    python run_all.py /path/to/ct/scans --skip-seg          # skip segmentation (already done)
